# FlaskAPI




This file contains a Flask Application built to demo the useage of SQL alchemy and the need for a user interface. The application is built as an api as well so, it can be called from external/non-native apps as well. The goal of this project is to provide programmers with a backbone for any data sorting app they would like to build.


We use Basic Bootstrap,HTML,CSS,JS for the front end.

We have used Ajax to communicate data to the Flask/python code for any backend server request.
